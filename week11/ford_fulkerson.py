"""Week 11 starter: Ford-Fulkerson, maximum flow and minimum cut.

A flow network is a directed acyclic graph stored as an adjacency matrix:
graph[u][v] is the CAPACITY of the edge from u to v, and 0 means there is no
edge. One vertex is the source (no incoming edges) and one is the target (no
outgoing edges). The method, as in class on 11/4 and 11/6:

    1. make a working copy of the matrix, the RESIDUAL graph;
    2. while the residual graph has a path from source to target
       (an AUGMENTING PATH):
           find the weakest edge on the path,
           SATURATE the path: subtract that flow from every forward edge
           and add it to every back edge;
           an edge whose capacity drops to 0 is gone;
    3. the vertices still reachable from the source are the set S, everything
       else is T. The edges of the ORIGINAL graph that go from S to T are the
       minimum cut, and their capacities add up to the maximum flow.

Read everything above the line "YOUR CODE STARTS HERE" before you write
anything. The functions below the line are yours. Every function that
returns a value has exactly one return.

    vertex can be reached by many different routes, and if the search only
    remembers the vertices on its CURRENT path, every time it reaches a dead
    end it forgets what it learned and tries the same dead ends again by the
    next route. The number of routes grows exponentially with the size of the
